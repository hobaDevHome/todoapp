### Introduction

The Todo application was developed to simplify task management for users. Its primary objectives include ease of use and functionality, allowing users to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete.

### Design Decisions

- **State Management:** Utilized React hooks such as `useState` for managing task data and `useEffect` for fetching initial tasks.
- **Component Structure:** Organized into reusable components like TodoList and TodoItem to enhance clarity and maintainability.
- **Styling Approach:** Applied basic CSS for styling and leveraged Framer Motion for smooth animations to improve user experience.
- **Interface Design:** Due to limited interface design resources, inspiration was drawn from platforms like Figma. A theme from Figma guided the visual appearance of the application.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented basic error handling to notify users if fields are empty when adding tasks.
- **Data Management:** Integrated data from a mock API and local storage to ensure task persistence and offline availability.

### Trade-offs

- Emphasized essential features within the project's scope while deferring more advanced functionalities for future updates.
- Prioritized simplicity to expedite development, maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.

### Challenges Faced

Encountered difficulties in managing asynchronous operations with React hooks. Overcame these challenges through thorough debugging and consultation of documentation and online resources.

### Conclusion

The design focused on delivering a user-friendly experience and sustainable maintenance. Future improvements could enhance error handling and introduce more complex data interactions.
