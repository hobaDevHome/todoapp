# Code Review: Todo Application

## Component Structure and Organization

**Notes:**

- The app is divided into components (`AddTodo`, `TodoList`, `TodoItem`).
  This makes the code easier to manage and reuse.
- Components are named clearly and serve specific functions.

**Suggestions:**

- Consider creating a `utils` directory for shared utility functions.

## State Management

**Notes:**

- State is managed using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`). This is appropriate for a small to medium-sized application.
- `useEffect` is used for fetching initial tasks, which is a good practice.

**Suggestions:**

- Use a state management library like Redux for larger applications to maintain scalability and manage complex state more effectively.

## Error Handling

**Notes:**

- Basic error handling is in place for form validation.
- Error messages are displayed to users when necessary fields are missing.

**Suggestions:**

- Enhance user feedback with more informative and context-specific error messages.
- Implement error boundaries in React to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree.

## Styling

**Notes:**

- CSS is used for basic styling, ensuring a simple and clean look.
- Framer Motion is utilized for animations, enhancing the user experience.

**Suggestions:**

- Consider using a CSS-in-JS library (e.g., styled-components) for better component-scoped styles.

## Best Practices

**Suggestions:**

- Ensure that all components are covered by unit tests to maintain robustness.
