### Overview of Codebase

#### Organized into Components

The codebase is structured around modular components such as AddTodo and TodoList, which enhances maintainability and reusability.

#### Utilization of React Hooks

Utilized React hooks like useState for state management and useEffect for handling side effects, promoting efficient and streamlined development.

### Code Review

#### Code Organization

- **Structure:** Generally well-organized with clear separation of components and consistent naming conventions.

#### State Management

- **Effective Use of Hooks:** Proper implementation of useState and useEffect hooks for managing component state and side effects.
- **Complex State Updates:** Recommend reviewing handling of complex state updates for potential optimizations, especially with larger datasets.

#### Error Handling

- **Basic Error Handling:** Basic error handling is implemented; consider improving user feedback with more descriptive error messages.

#### Performance

- **Optimizations:** Evaluate rendering performance for large datasets; consider implementing useMemo hook for memoization to optimize render cycles.

#### Best Practices

- **DRY Principle:** Encourage applying the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle to reduce redundancy and enhance code maintainability.

### Specific Improvements

- **Refactoring Opportunities:** Identify and refactor repetitive logic into helper functions to improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Render Optimization:** Explore methods to optimize rendering efficiency, particularly when dealing with extensive data sets.
